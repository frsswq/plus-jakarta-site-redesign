    The Plus Jakarta Sans is a versatile modern type family designed for Plus
    Jakarta City Branding in 2020, where each glyph has its own varieties with
    its own different characteristics. Like the city itself, the beauty is in
    the details. The charms of Plus Jakarta Sans appear when one looks closer,
    manifesting in a beauty that emerges once seen as a whole. Each alternate on
    Display family contains several alternates characters, while the text
    version has a small adjustment to preserve the legibility of small sizes.
